**Three 6 Mafia** is a hip hop group originally from Memphis, Tennessee, signed to Sony Music Entertainment under the Columbia Records imprint.
Formed in 1991 as Backyard Posse then later Triple 6 Mafia, by DJ Paul, Lord Infamous, Juicy J and Koopsta Knicca, the group later included two more members including; **Crunchy Black and Gangsta Boo** (both added shortly before the release of their debut album Mystic Stylez).
The group has also collaborated with many other rappers on their own label; Hypnotize Minds, where they launched the careers of many Memphis rappers, such as Frayser Boy, Gangsta Blac, Lil Wyte and Indo G.
The group frequently collaborates with Project Pat (Juicy J's older brother). Their 2005 song "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp" from the 2005 film Hustle and Flow won Best Original Song at the 78th Academy Awards, with the group being the first hip hop artists to perform at the ceremony.

The group released their debut underground album Mystic Stylez in 1995 through Prophet Entertainment, a record label they created but have since relinquished control of.
Their musical style—which initially featured dark, menacing beats with equally gritty lyrics—has since moved to a more mainstream sound. The group has also had numerous lineup changes, and now consists of original members Juicy J and DJ Paul.
Nonetheless, they have cultivated a sizable and diverse cult following that has only increased since their Oscar win.
Two of their albums are RIAA-rated platinum: *When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1 (2000) and Most Known Unknown (2005)*, the latter featured their well-known single "Stay Fly", which is said to have kick-started their rise to fame and the mainstream. The group's worldwide album sales stand at 5.5 million. In 2013, five of the original members reunited, performing under the name Da Mafia 6ix, and are planning to release a new album in 2014.[2]
